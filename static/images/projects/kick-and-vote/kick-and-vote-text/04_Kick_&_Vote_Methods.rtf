\f0\fs26 \cf0 We created and facilitated a series of hands-on workshops combining soccer, creative activities such as graffiti and poster-making, and activities for creating rules and decisions together. Participants were invited to experiment with new rules, negotiate outcomes, and reflect on their experiences in a supportive environment.\
Our team worked closely with local youth centers to engage participants, build trust, and ensure accessibility across different backgrounds and languages. The project culminated in two public soccer tournaments, providing participants the opportunity to apply the rules and decisions they created together in practice.}
