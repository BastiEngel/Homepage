## Rules

- **Dev server**: At session start, run `npm run dev -- --open` in the background so changes are always visible in the browser.
- **Branching**: Never commit new features directly to `main`. Always create a feature branch first.
- **Commits**: Incremental commits for every feature. Short, single line messages only.
- **Authorship**: Never add Claude as co-author or contributor to commit messages.
