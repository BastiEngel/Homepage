The project focused on young people aged 14 to 21 in an area with low political engagement and limited access to cultural activities.\n\nSoccer offers low-threshold access and immediate participation across backgrounds and languages. Kick & Vote created an open, playful, low-threshold space where young people could take the initiative, explore political participation, actively shape their environment by creating their own rules, make collective decisions, and experience empowerment through interaction, soccer, and joy."

				"text": "We created and facilitated a series of hands-on workshops combining soccer, creative activities such as graffiti and poster-making, and activities for creating rules and decisions together. Participants were invited to experiment with new rules, negotiate outcomes, and reflect on their experiences in a supportive environment.\n\nOur team worked closely with local youth centers to engage participants, build trust, and ensure accessibility across different backgrounds and languages. The project culminated in two public soccer tournaments, providing participants the opportunity to apply the rules and decisions they created together in practice."

Participants actively shaped rules, made collective decisions, and learned to respect different perspectives. Workshops and tournaments provided spaces for discussion, co-creation, and inclusive participation, empowering young people to experience their own agency and influence within the group."
